Python Basketball Game.

Can be played with two-player local quickplay, single-player quickplay vs. AI or through career mode.

Players play 3-on-3 basketball and move around a 2D court. When moving around in 2D, the offensive player has the ability to pass to a
target of their choice, shoot the ball or perform a crossover dribble. The defensive player can also switch between who they are controlling
and attempt to steal the ball in 2D. If the offensive player performs a crossover at the moment the defensive player attempts a steal, the
defensive player gets crossed up and is rendered immobile for a few seconds. However, the offensive player has a chance of losing the ball
when performing a crossover. In addition, when an offensive player initiates a shot, the camera switches to a cross-sectional view where the
defensive player has the opportunity to jump up and block the shot. In order to maximize their chance of making a shot, the offensive player
must release the ball at the peak of their shot.

There are 4 teams to possibly play as, each specializing in a certain playstyle. Each individual player also has certain traits which affect
how they control.

Height/Weight- Affects how tall/heavy the player is
Speed- Affects how fast the player moves around the court
Strength- Affects how well the player can push other players around and how fast they can pass the ball
Passing- Affects how accurate a player can pass the ball
Ball Handling- Affects how likely a player is to perform a successful crossover and how well they can guard against the ball being stolen
Shot Form- Affects the release angle of a player's shot
Shot Accuracy (Short, Medium, Long)- Affects the likelihood of a shot going in at the appropriate range
Stealing- Affects how likely a player is to perform a successful steal and the duration of their stealing animation
Blocking- Affects how fast a player can get up to block a ball
Rebounding- Affects how fast a player can close out when rebounding and the likelihood of grabbing a loose rebound
Jump- Affects how high the player jumps when in the cross-sectional view

In addition, there are different positions. Guards tend to be smaller and weaker, but are generally more adept at ball handling, 
stealing and passing. Forwards tend to have average strength/height and good shooting mechanics. Centers are generally the tallest and
strongest players with great rebounding and shot blocking abilities. Centers also have the unique ability to dunk the ball if they get
close enough to the basket.

The singleplayer career mode implements these same gameplay mechanics, but with a progression system. Each time you generate a new career
player, they are put on a random team, given a random position and assigned rather poor starting stats to match their position. You have
the opportunity to play other teams while controlling your player (you cannot switch who you are controlling in this mode since this is
meant to simulate your own player career). As you play, you earn a grade depending on how well you perform (your shooting percentage,
turnover ratio etc.). Earning positive teammate grades and completing achievements that have been laid out enables you to earn VC which
you can use to upgrade your player's stats.
